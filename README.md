# Simulation of Lunar precession using Leapfrog integration
- `params.py` contains initial parameters for simulation and gets copied into the directory, containing simulation results
- `simulation.py` contains the code that produces x,y,z coordinates for specified bodies
- `analysis.py` used to plot the results (warning - the code will make you sick)
